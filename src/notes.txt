Mitchs notes on how server works, or atleast should work hopefully



                    -=-=-=-=- game launching -=-=-=-=-

Games launched start in singleplayer mode, and via some options menu multilplayer can be enabled

When you first boot up the game the main within user starts up, when you actually get into a
world it first creates the server then the client, when opening world through singleplayer, client
is connected to server via the "localhost" ip.

something like Client p1 = Client("localhost",*port?*);


Players computer :
*----------------------------------------------*
|   (keyboard input) ---->                     |
|   Client(local host)      Internal Server()  |
|   (visual output)  <----                     |
*----------------------------------------------*


when a game is then set to host in multiplayer the internal server then allows for connection of
other players
